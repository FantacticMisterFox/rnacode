RNAcode -- Analyze the protein coding potential in multiple sequence alignments

0. About RNAcode
================

The purpose of RNA code is to detect protein coding regions in a set
of homologous nucleotide sequences. RNAcode relies on evolutionary
signatures, mainly synonymous/conservative mutations and conservation
of the reading frame. These characteristics indicate negative
selection acting on an encoded protein and allow sensitive and
specific detection of coding regions. 

RNAcode does not rely on any species specific sequence characteristics
whatsoever and does not use any machine learning techniques. The only
input required for RNAcode is a multiple sequence alignment either in
MAF or Clustal W format. RNAcode reports local regions of unusual high
coding potential and an associated p-value.


1. Installation
===============

You can compile and install RNAcode like this:

# ./configure
# make
# make install (as root)

See INSTALL for details and more advanced installation options.
